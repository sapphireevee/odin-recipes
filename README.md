This is The Odin Project's (TOP) first html coding project.
In this, I hope to learn the basics of git (adding, committing, pushing) and html (basic framework, text stylizations, links, images).
The functions I hope to familiarize myself for git include:
    clone
    log
    status
    add (. --> All files in directory)
    commit (-m "comment")
    push (origin margin)
